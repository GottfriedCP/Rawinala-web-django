            <p>You can be involved in Rawinala's services through the following programs:</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Foster Parents Program (Schools and Dormitories).</strong> Most of Rawinala's children come from families with weak economies. They need your helping hand to continue to school and get quality care.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Education and Care Worker Welfare.</strong> Educators and caregivers are the main force in all Rawinala's activities. You can help to improve their welfare through this program.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Teacher Training at the Training Center.</strong> Through this program, you can help children with multiple disabilities in the supported regions to be able to access education.</li>

            <p>As a private social institution, Rawinala has many challenges to achieve its goals. The main challenge is in the area of funding. For more than 40 years of service, Rawinala has never had a permanent funder. Rawinala must fight from month to month to make ends meet.</p>
